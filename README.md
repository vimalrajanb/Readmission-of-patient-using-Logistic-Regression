# Readmission-of-patient-using-Logistic-Regression

n this project, I have developed a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of an individual being readmitted to a medical facility. By utilizing a well-established statistical technique, logistic regression, I can effectively analyze and interpret the relationship between various input features and the binary outcome of whether a patient is readmitted or not.

Additionally, comprehensive performance metrics have been computed to assess the effectiveness of the developed model. These metrics provide valuable insights into the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, offering a clear understanding of its predictive capabilities. The project's code can be found in the associated GitHub repository.
